## Task:

* My Task is to build two apps ... Admin & User apps.
* I created the features as Flutter packages to be reusable in any project.
* I used Melos to handle the mono repo logic and implement two apps in the same repo.
* I used Supabase to handle authentication & handle validation [Admin or Usdr]
* I used Supabase as a backend server side to store & handle data.
* User Can view available cars & can book them with a specific Date. 
* The Car can't be booked twice for the same date range.
* Admin Can apply (CRUD) operations for the car.
* User & admin both can view booking history.
*
